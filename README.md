# UFOs Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. This will allow for use specificity when utilizing the UFO sightings search engine.

## Results
When a user logs onto the webpage they start off at the home page:


Once they scroll down beyond the article and paragraph, they will see the search engine on the bottom left-hand side titled "Filter Search." Here there is the option to filter their search by five categories: date of sighting, city of sighting, state of sighting. country of sighting, and shape of UFO spotted.



If a user wanted to look up the sighting of a circular UFO sighting that occurred on January 1, 2010, in Benton, Arkansas, their search would look like this:



Once the have filtered their search, the results will be show on a table to the right:



## Summary
Overall, this is a convenient search engine that allows for users to find the specific sighting they desire more information on. A drawback of this design is how the search engine is on the same page as the article and paragraph. It would be visually appealing if the two were on separate pages.

For further development, I would recommend the search include a dropdown menu as it will save space since everything is on one page. I would also recommend more a duration filter since this may be helpful in locating a specific sighting.
